                Governance refers to the mechanisms, processes, and institutions through which individuals and groups articulate their interests, exercise their rights, mediate their differences, and enforce their collective decisions. It encompasses the rules, norms, and procedures that guide the actions of individuals and institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective governance ensures that resources are used efficiently, public policies are formulated and implemented transparently, and the rights and interests of all members of society are respected and protected. It involves participation, accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and the rule of law.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good governance fosters social cohesion, economic development, and political stability. It promotes trust in government institutions, enhances the legitimacy of the state, and contributes to the well-being of citizens.
